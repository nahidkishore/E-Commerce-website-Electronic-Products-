# E-Commerce-website(Electronic-Products)
(Online Shopping System)

#This is my university personal Project.

#Project Overview:

Admin will have full access to the system. He will have the privilege to add or remove a product, customer etc. User can signup/login/logout. Users can view lists of items for sale and search by name, filter by price. Users can add items to the shopping cart and can view all the items in their shopping cart. Users can delete items in the shopping cart. The shopping cart uses an integer column to store "state". Shows the total price of all items. Users can fill in the form and submit billing info. After submitting billing info, items in the shopping cart will move to a different "state".
Add a search box to items listing page, search uses to get and query params to generate a new page. The search query uses the name and description fields.


Thank You.
